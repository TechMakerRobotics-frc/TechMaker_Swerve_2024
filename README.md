## Hello everyone,

### This is our swerve code for 2024.

#### Some new features and capabilities include:

- **Logging System**: We use **AdvantageKit** for robust and detailed logging of robot data during matches and testing.

- **Trajectory Planner**: We leverage **PathPlanner** for precise trajectory generation and execution, including real-time trajectory creation.

- **Simulation**: We integrate with **AdvantageScope** for comprehensive robot simulation, debugging, and data analysis.

- **Vision System**: Using **PhotonVision**, our robot can detect and align with **AprilTags**, enabling advanced autonomous capabilities.

- **Localization**: The robot performs automatic field-relative localization using **AprilTags**, improving navigation and consistency in autonomous modes.

- **Control System**:
  - Implemented **ThrottleMap** for customizable acceleration curves, ensuring smoother and more controlled driving.
  - PID-controlled alignment with vision targets, enabling accurate positioning.

- **Real-Time Trajectory Adjustment**: Our system supports **on-the-fly trajectory generation**, adapting to dynamic conditions during a match.
